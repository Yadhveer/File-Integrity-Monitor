# File-Integrity-Monitor

This is a basic python based application in the field of information security. This is based on hashing a text file using SHA-256 and storing the same in a mysql database. The stored hash is then cross checked with a new hash that is generated on running the program and then gives an alert if the hash changes, as that means that its file has changed.
